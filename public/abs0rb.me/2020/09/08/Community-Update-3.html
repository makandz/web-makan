      <h3 id="welcome-back">Welcome back</h3>
      <p>
        Welcome back to the 3rd iteration of the v5 community updates, this one is a good one! If
        you haven’t read the second update, it’s available to see through <a href="/blog">here</a>.
      </p>

      <h3 id="everything-in-profiles">Everything in profiles</h3>
      <p>
        Inventory, profiles, case information, and friends have been combined into one central
        place, your profile.
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="/assets/blog-img/community-update/14.png" alt="user profile" />
      </p>

      <p>
        Skins have got a complete overhaul at how they’re displayed. We’ve moved over to card views
        for skins, giving you a pleasant and more complete look at all those skins that you’ve
        worked hard to gather. There’s also a new subtle background animation for legendary and
        event skins.
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="/assets/blog-img/community-update/15.gif" alt="skin preview" class="mw-150" />
      </p>

      <h3 id="starting-on-the-left">Starting on the left</h3>
      <p>
        The good ol’ profile view is still here, but with a few more tricks up it’s sleeve. By
        default, profiles don’t show all the information unless if you click show more, which will
        then give you this big boi.
      </p>

      <p>
        <img
          src="/assets/blog-img/community-update/16.png"
          alt="user preview card"
          class="mw-400"
        />
      </p>

      <p>
        You’re now able to see the users set skin, more weekly stats, and when the user was last
        online. There’s also a nice little colored strip at the top of accounts that have locked
        names or a special role. One final thing is that online users get a green outline on their
        profile photo when you visit their profile, signifying that they are online.
      </p>

      <h3 id="friends-or-enemies">Friends or enemies</h3>
      <p>Users are now able to add or block others directly on their profiles.</p>

      <p>
        <img
          src="/assets/blog-img/community-update/17.png"
          alt="other user preview card"
          class="mw-400"
        />
      </p>

      <p>
        By blocking users, you’ll no longer receive trade or friend requests from them. By adding
        them, you can set your account to private trade mode (coming soon!) that only let’s you get
        trades from users that are your friend. You also get a neat little friends panel on your
        profile that shows your online friends.
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="/assets/blog-img/community-update/18.png" alt="online friends" class="mw-400" />
      </p>

      <p>You can also view other users friends plus manage your own with one click of a button.</p>

      <p>
        <img src="/assets/blog-img/community-update/19.png" alt="friends panel" class="mw-500" />
      </p>

      <p>Don’t forget about managing friend requests, both inbound and outbound.</p>

      <p>
        <img src="/assets/blog-img/community-update/20.png" alt="outbound friends" class="mw-650" />
      </p>

      <h3 id="selling-your-items">Selling your items</h3>
      <p>
        We’ve cleaned up the look of selling skins. Equipped with the same features you loved from
        v4, with recommended price placeholders and the ability to see how much you get after the
        sale.
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="/assets/blog-img/community-update/21.png" alt="sell panel" class="mw-650" />
      </p>

      <h3 id="trash-makeover">Trash makeover</h3>
      <p>
        Quick sell is essentially the same thing as trash, but better. You now have the ability to
        trash all types of items (except events), and you’ll get rewarded different amount of coins
        for each item. Still got that pesky Coltan case you’re never going to open and nobody is
        ever going to buy? You can quick sell it and get something useful in return.
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="/assets/blog-img/community-update/22.png" alt="trash panel" class="mw-650" />
      </p>

      <p>
        It’s also directly available via the sell panel, so you can see the cheapest listing of the
        skin before you quick sell it.
      </p>

      <h3 id="open-those-cases">Open those cases!</h3>
      <p>
        Like everything else, opening cases is also directly baked into the profile page. You don’t
        need to jump between 300 different pages trying to open a few cases, but now you can just
        click two buttons and bingo bongo, your cases are openo pongo.
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="/assets/blog-img/community-update/23.png" alt="open case panel" class="mw-650" />
      </p>

      <p>
        There’s also a neat little skin particle animation once you’ve opened up a case, colored by
        the skins rarity.
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="/assets/blog-img/community-update/24.gif" alt="open animation" class="mw-150" />
      </p>

      <h3 id="were-almost-there">We’re almost there..</h3>
      <p>
        Thanks to all the alpha testers for helping us patch those pesky little bugs, within the
        past few weeks we’ve fixed over 30+ different issues across the website! We want to make
        sure this update is as polished and feature-packed as it can be, so we’re working hard on
        polishing everything in such a short period of time. If you want to stay up to date with
        more v5 alpha news, join our

      <h3 id="welcome">Welcome</h3>
      <p>
        You’ve probably never seen this before. This is something new I’m trying out, essentially
        I’ll be posting a community update every 2 - 3 weeks (starting today) to keep everyone up to
        date with the current information and progress of the upcoming v5 update. This update is
        huge, we’ve spent a lot of time planning and finding ways to make our backend as
        future-proof as possible. It may have taken a while, but we are on the home stretch!
      </p>

      <h3 id="boring-stuff-out-of-the-way">Boring stuff out of the way</h3>
      <p>
        We haven’t been working on anything too excited at the moment. Mainly website backend stuff
        to make sure user login, registration, commands, etc are all as streamlined as possible. The
        current backend was built during v2 era, it’s more than two years old! I’ve heard all of
        your complaints, such as the infamous password request issue that only lets you request a
        password reset once. We’re working closely in fixing up these issues and making the
        security, accessibility, and reliability of our members system.
      </p>

      <h3 id="registration-is-better-than-ever">Registration is better than ever</h3>
      <p>Let’s get registration out of the way first.</p>

      <p>
        <img src="/assets/blog-img/community-update/1.png" alt="register panel" />
      </p>

      <p>
        Creating an account is now as seamless as possible. No longer will you get refreshed when
        you make a mistake resulting in the data you entered into your input to be reset. No more
        having to type in the characters of the letters every time for the captcha check. Mistakes
        in input fields are now also checked on the client-side before being sent to the server. Why
        is this helpful you may ask? You’ll be instantly notified of mistakes within your form and
        everything you spent time inputting won’t be reset until you’ve completed the form and have
        successfully registered for an account. Alongside this, alerts are now redesigned and will
        fluently slide down notifying you of issues with your form.
      </p>

      <h3 id="updating-your-account-settings">Updating your account settings</h3>
      <p>
        Updating account settings was redone from the ground-up. We added a few icons and improved
        the overall design and used the same client-side checks from the registration system here as
        well.
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="/assets/blog-img/community-update/3.png" alt="update account settings panel" />
      </p>

      <h3 id="keeping-you-secure">Keeping you secure</h3>
      <p>
        Keeping your accounts secure is our number one priority. Over the past 4 years, we’ve
        learned a lot about ways to keep you protected, and we haven’t stopped. v5 introduces many
        new security implementations, improved the security of authentication tokens to prevent
        shady extensions from being able to steal your login token. Updating any user settings will
        be logged and crucial settings updates will get email notifications sent to the user
        account. We’ve also introduced website rollback. For example, if you’re buying a skin and
        suddenly the website decides to shut down, none of your coins or data will be lost - the
        website will automatically revert the changes it’s made.
      </p>

      <h3 id="thats-not-all">That’s not all</h3>
      <p>
        There have been so many changes, it’s hard to even keep track of them anymore! Many of the
        changes were not listed in this post, we hope to let everyone get access to these during the
        public beta which should roll out in the upcoming weeks. Keep up to date and get in contact
        with the developers via our
        <a href="https://discord.com/invite/7DYTZdm">Discord</a> and get a chance to join our alpha
        testers team to get hands-on access to v5 before anyone else. I’ll try to release a new
        community update in the upcoming weeks, see you soon!

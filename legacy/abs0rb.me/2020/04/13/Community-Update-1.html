      <h3 id="welcome">Welcome</h3>
      <p>
        You’ve probably never seen this before. This is something new I’m trying
        out, essentially I’ll be posting a community update every 2 - 3 weeks
        (starting today) to keep everyone up to date with the current
        information and progress of the upcoming v5 update. This update is huge,
        we’ve spent a lot of time planning and finding ways to make our backend
        as future-proof as possible. It may have taken a while, but we are on
        the home stretch!
      </p>

      <h3 id="boring-stuff-out-of-the-way">Boring stuff out of the way</h3>
      <p>
        We haven’t been working on anything too excited at the moment. Mainly
        website backend stuff to make sure user login, registration, commands,
        etc are all as streamlined as possible. The current backend was built
        during v2 era, it’s more than two years old! I’ve heard all of your
        complaints, such as the infamous password request issue that only lets
        you request a password reset once. We’re working closely in fixing up
        these issues and making the security, accessibility, and reliability of
        our members system.
      </p>

      <h3 id="registration-is-better-than-ever">
        Registration is better than ever
      </h3>
      <p>Let’s get registration out of the way first.</p>

      <p>
        <img
          src="/assets/blog-img/community-update/1.png"
          alt="register panel"
        />
      </p>

      <p>
        Creating an account is now as seamless as possible. No longer will you
        get refreshed when you make a mistake resulting in the data you entered
        into your input to be reset. No more having to type in the characters of
        the letters every time for the captcha check. Mistakes in input fields
        are now also checked on the client-side before being sent to the server.
        Why is this helpful you may ask? You’ll be instantly notified of
        mistakes within your form and everything you spent time inputting won’t
        be reset until you’ve completed the form and have successfully
        registered for an account. Alongside this, alerts are now redesigned and
        will fluently slide down notifying you of issues with your form.
      </p>

      <p>
        <img
          src="/assets/blog-img/community-update/2.png"
          alt="email in use error"
        />
      </p>

      <h3 id="updating-your-account-settings">
        Updating your account settings
      </h3>
      <p>
        Updating account settings was redone from the ground-up. We added a few
        icons and improved the overall design and used the same client-side
        checks from the registration system here as well.
      </p>

      <p>
        <img
          src="/assets/blog-img/community-update/3.png"
          alt="update account settings panel"
        />
      </p>

      <h3 id="keeping-you-secure">Keeping you secure</h3>
      <p>
        Keeping your accounts secure is our number one priority. Over the past 4
        years, we’ve learned a lot about ways to keep you protected, and we
        haven’t stopped. v5 introduces many new security implementations,
        improved the security of authentication tokens to prevent shady
        extensions from being able to steal your login token. Updating any user
        settings will be logged and crucial settings updates will get email
        notifications sent to the user account. We’ve also introduced website
        rollback. For example, if you’re buying a skin and suddenly the website
        decides to shut down, none of your coins or data will be lost - the
        website will automatically revert the changes it’s made.
      </p>

      <h3 id="thats-not-all">That’s not all</h3>
      <p>
        There have been so many changes, it’s hard to even keep track of them
        anymore! Many of the changes were not listed in this post, we hope to
        let everyone get access to these during the public beta which should
        roll out in the upcoming weeks. Keep up to date and get in contact with
        the developers via our
        <a href="https://discord.com/invite/7DYTZdm">Discord</a> and get a
        chance to join our alpha testers team to get hands-on access to v5
        before anyone else. I’ll try to release a new community update in the
        upcoming weeks, see you soon!
